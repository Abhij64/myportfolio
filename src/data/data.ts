        description: 'AI-powered platform offering optimized fertilizer recommendations using crop, soil, and real-time weather data.',
        overview: 'FarmEasy is a MedTech platform developed for the IT Dept. of NCT of Delhi that ensures timely and efficient fertilizer usage. It enhances yield through data-driven recommendations while offering voice-based multilingual input and NLP processing.',
        problem: 'Farmers struggle with inefficient fertilizer usage due to lack of real-time insights and complex interfaces. We needed a solution that bridges the digital divide while optimizing yield.',
        research: 'Field surveys and expert interviews revealed that simplifying the interface with multilingual support and integrating real-time weather data could vastly improve user engagement and crop outcomes.',
        process: 'We used a machine learning model (Random Forest) trained on agricultural datasets. The system supports Telugu speech input, real-time city-based weather fetching, and fertilizer prediction with Django integration.',
        outcome: 'FarmEasy led to a 35% increase in fertilizer efficiency and a 20% boost in yield during pilot tests. The platform simplifies agri-decision making with data-driven automation.',

        description: 'AI-powered real estate insights platform for smarter property decisions based on trends, location, and risk analysis.',
        overview: 'ReState combines AI and GIS data to help users make informed real estate investments. Features include fraud risk detection, dynamic pricing prediction, and neighborhood analysis.',
        problem: 'Buyers and investors often lack analytical tools to evaluate properties thoroughly, leading to risky decisions and fraud vulnerability.',
        research: 'We analyzed buyer pain points and studied property fraud patterns. This revealed a need for visual, data-backed decision-making tools.',
        process: 'Using machine learning and open GIS datasets, we developed a platform that evaluates properties using heatmaps, risk analysis, and fraud detection models.',
        outcome: 'ReState improved user decision confidence by 70%, and pilot users avoided overvaluation risks using its price forecasting tool.',

        overview: 'Agrivoyage is an innovative platform that bridges the gap between agricultural communities and tourism, creating sustainable income sources for farmers while offering authentic experiences for travelers.',
        problem: 'Rural farming communities often struggle with inconsistent income. Meanwhile, urban dwellers increasingly seek authentic experiences away from commercial tourism. There was no effective platform connecting these two groups.',
        research: 'Through interviews with farmers and potential tourists, we identified key features that would make the platform attractive to both groups. We also studied successful agritourism models from different countries.',
        process: 'We developed the platform using a user-centered design approach, creating prototypes that were tested with both farmers and potential tourists. The feedback loop helped refine the booking process and communication tools.',
        outcome: 'The platform successfully increased participating farmers\' income by approximately 30%. Tourist satisfaction ratings show a 92% positive response rate, with many highlighting the authentic experiences as the main value.',
